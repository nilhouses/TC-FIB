# TC-FIB
This repository contains exercises for the Computation Theory (TC) course at FIB-UPC.

You will find solved exercices (.png) and the thought process I used to solve them
(.txt), which is written in catalan. The exercices consist on the following formal language 
generators:  

    Regular descriptions (Reg)
    Context-free grammars (CFG)
    Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)
    Pushdown Automata (PDA)
    K-Reductions (K)
    CFG-Reductions (CFG)

All the exercises were obtained from [RACSO](https://racso.lsi.upc.edu/juezwsgi/index)
